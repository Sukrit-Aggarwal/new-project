        <p>AUD scope is a BitBucket repository belonging to a single team 
            and which contain all AUD definition (Component and Dependencies)
            for this team.
        </p>

        <p>Two types of scope exist:</p>

        <dl class = "dl">
            <dt>Infrastructure scope</dt>
            <dd> - that are under infrastructure team's responsibility</dd>
            <dt>Application scope</dt>
            <dd> - corresponds to a functional split and contains one APP</dd>
        </dl>

        <p>Infrastucture and application scopes data 
            <strong>should not be merged</strong> 
            in the same scope as they have different 
            SLA/lifecycle and ownership/access rights.
